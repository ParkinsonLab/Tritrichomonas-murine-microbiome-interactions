The genome assembly presented here was generated from 1 million CANU-corrected PacBio reads using FLYE, and polished using pilon with 8.6 million Illumina MiSeq 2x300 read pairs.
Gene models were predicted using the MAKER pipeline with SNAP and Augustus algorithms, and gene functions are based on sequence similarity searches using Interpro, PFAM prediction and enzyme prediction using ARCHITECT.
