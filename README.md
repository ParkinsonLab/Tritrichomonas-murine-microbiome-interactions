# Tritrichomonas-murine-microbiome-interactions
A project interrogating the activities of murine gut protozoan Tritrichomonas, and its impact on the bacterial communities in healthy and IgA-deficient hosts. This study includes a protozoan draft genome assembly, single cell RNA-Seq data, and 16S bacterial and metatranscriptomics sequencing over the first month of colonization.
